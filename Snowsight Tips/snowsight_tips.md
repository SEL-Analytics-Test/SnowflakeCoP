### Query shortcuts
* You can find various shortcuts built into the Snowsight UI (3 dots on the script tab, see below)  
![snowsight query shorcuts](Snowsight Tips\images\snowsight_shortcuts.png)

* `Ctrl` + `Enter` - run the script up to the next semi-colon (;)
* `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter` - run the whole script
* `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `H` - Find and replace (doesn’t automatically pick up the word you are highlighting, like SSMS)
* `Ctrl` + `/` - comment the line the cursor is on
* Highlighting any text and typing double quotations puts "" around the text without deleting the text (as you'd expect normally) 
This also works with single quotes and any left brackets.
Alt + mouse drag OR Alt + arrow keys. This just lets you edit multiple lines at once similar to ssms. It’s much better at editing the end of lines of varying lengths however.
